## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project performs text mining, sentiment analysis, and association rule mining on a Turkish news dataset.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean, tokenize, and analyze textual data, then applies statistical and visualization methods to uncover patterns, sentiment polarity, and frequent word associations.

The dataset contains Turkish news texts, and the workflow includes:
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation and number removal, stopword removal, whitespace cleaning)
- Tokenization into words
- Word frequency analysis
- Sentiment polarity detection (positive/negative)
- Word cloud visualization
- Association rule mining using Apriori algorithm
- Visualization of rules and frequent itemsets

## ðŸ“‚ Files in the Project
- haber.txt â†’ Raw news text data.
- ref.StopWordListTR.csv and stopwords-tr.txt â†’ Turkish stopword lists.
- TurkishSentiment-positive.txt and TurkishSentiment-negative.txt â†’ Lists of positive and negative Turkish sentiment words.
- Sentimental_analiysis.Rmd â†’ R Markdown file containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Output
- Word Cloud: Highlights the most common Turkish words in the dataset.
- Sentiment Histogram: Shows distribution of positive/negative polarity.
- Association Graph: Displays relationships between frequent word pairs.
